# Numerical-Algorithms---task1


Question 1 (easy)
Find the roots of in the interval using the
 Bisection Method
 Fixed-Point Method (find a proper )
 Newton's Method (use initial guess of 3
with tolerance of . Write your code and the final answer. Also, report how
many iterations did each algorithm take to reach the final answer.

Question 2 (easy)
In Session 2, we solved the equation by defining

and solving the equation using the Fixed Point method in
the interval . Now, try a different and write the steps you followed to
check if it meets the algorithm's conditions, write your code, and write the
found answer.

Question 3 (easy)
Find the roots of in the interval using
 Bisection Method
 Newton's Method, but use the initial guess of 1. What happens? Why?

Question 4 (medium)
Solve the the Fibonacci equation 12th century) .
Compute one solution using any of the 3 methods. Write your code and the
final answer.
